# NodeJS Unreal Engine Libraries and CLI

This repo contains some work I did over a year ago when I was trying to use Unreal on Linux and to be able to download Marketplace assets without having to download them on Windows. A lot of this is based off https://github.com/Allar/ue4-mp-downloader, but modernized, modularized, etc.

I'm fairly certain auth no longer works (writing this Oct 2021) as it was a hacky method. I may work on this from time to time, but this repo should be considered unmaintained.
